# Drumstick
This project is a dynamic drumstick app developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to play virtual drum sounds by pressing specific keys on their keyboard. The HTML structure lays out the drum keys, each associated with a unique sound. CSS provides a visually appealing design, including key styling and interactive animations. JavaScript captures keyboard events, triggering audio playback and visual effects for a responsive experience. Keydown and keyup event listeners ensure seamless sound generation and visual cues. This engaging project showcases how the trio of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript collaborates to create an interactive and enjoyable virtual drumming experience.
